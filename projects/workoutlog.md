summary: "A mobile app I developed for Android to log workouts and track progress."
---

While at the gym I noticed many people writing down the exercises they were doing. I thought that this was a good idea to track my progress, but I did not want to go through the hassle of carrying around a notebook and pencil. I tried logging my progress on a notes app, but formatting it on a phone was difficult. I created an app that allows you to log your exercises and how many repititions, sets, and what weight you used in a simple and convenient way. You can also view graphs of your progess for each exercise.

I created this app with Android Studio after teaching myself the Kotlin programming language using the Android developers website. For the databse side of the app, I used SQLite.
