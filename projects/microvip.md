summary: "Training neural networks to recognize/measure the trophectoderm epithelium and inner cell mass sizes of embryos for use in in vitro fertilization"
---

My team's goal was to train a neural network that would be able to recognize the trophectoderm epithelium (TE) and inner cell mass (ICM) of an embryo with a high accuracy. This network would then be able to be used in the process of choosing embryos for use in in vitro fertilization. Since we were given a relatively small amount of images labeled with the TE and ICM by embryologists, my job consisted of augmenting these images so that we could train the neural networks with more images. I also worked on the graphical user interface that displayed the results of the neural network.
