This semester I registered for ICS 314, which is a software engineering course. The battle between me and the course was a legendary one, with ups and downs, but in the end, I came out victorious. Hereâ€™s an account of some of the notable fights.

## Reid vs. Agile Project Management

One of the software engineering skills taught in ICS 314 was Agile project management. This skill requires one to break down a large project into smaller portions which allow the project developer to better tackle the project. I have always been the type of person who tries to get everything done in one sitting. When I have momentum I feel like I do my best work. However, for the project that our team decided to take on, this approach would be nearly impossible. The project was far too complex to be completed in one sitting. I had to learn to create milestones which contain certain issues that need to be addressed. Altogether, these milestones would result in a completed project. This approach was much more reasonable and helped keep my sanity. I anticipate this skill being extremely useful in my future endeavors. I do not think it is likely that my job will give me the type of work that can be done in one sitting. I will have to apply what I learned from this class to break the work into pieces that are reasonable to achieve in a certain amount of time.

## What the Future Holds

In the future I would like to explore more software engineering opportunities. Although I do enjoy the problem solving aspect of software engineering, I find it fascinating to work on and learn about many different projects. I especially like the idea of working on projects that are on the cutting edge of technology because knowing I was a part of something that was groundbreaking would be deeply satisfying. To achieve these goals, I believe the greatest asset I can have is being a better programmer. All the jobs and internships I hear about have coding interviews that often require one to be a very competent programmer. Improving my programming skills would help greatly in my endeavor of finding the job I want. In my case, the ability of optimizing programs may be the skill that I need to improve most. When I have a programming problem given to me, I can think of solutions, but they are often not the best way to solve that problem. Learning strategies that will help with optimization would allow me to think of better ways to solve problems.
